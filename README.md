<p align="justify"> 
Conducted a tweet classification task involving disaster related tweets , with corpus subjected to exploratory data analysis resulting in two balanced classes: disaster and fake disaster. The text cleaning process involved lemmatization, stemming and removal of unwanted tokens such as emojis and stop words. <br><br>
Executed series of experiments utilizing various vectorization and embedding techniques, as well as models such as Naive-Bayes, XGBoost and neural network based architectures. Through a rigorous analysis, the LTSM model, utilizing GlOve embedding for tokens was determined to be the most effective model with an accuracy of approximately 80%.
